# JavaScript challenge (project three)

## Description

In this project, I learned how to use the basics of JavaScript (JS) to build the mechanics and aethetics of a simple, interactive webpage that generated a randomized password based on the user's preferences (how many characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, or special characters). I learned a lot about different JS functions and the use of For Loops. This is the live server page: http://127.0.0.1:5501/index.html and github pages: https://github.com/AStandish/JSchallenge1,  https://astandish.github.io/JSchallenge1/.
